# Sentiment Analysis with BERT Neural Network and Python
## BERTSentiment_main_Sentiment.ipynb
Can't be bothered building a model from scratch?

Transformers allows you to easily leverage a pre-trained BERT neural network to do exactly that!

In this notebook we'll go through how to get up and running with Hugging Face Transformers and BERT to be able to calculate sentiment. We'll run the model using a single prompt but also leverage BeautifulSoup to scrape reviews from Yelp to be able to calculate sentiment on a larger scale. 

In this Notebook you'll learn how to: 
1. Install Transformers
2. Scrape reviews from Yelp and Calculate their Sentiment.
3. Perform Sentiment Scoring using BERT and Python
